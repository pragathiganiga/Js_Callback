# Download Image Button

A simple web page that allows users to download an image by clicking a button. The page is styled with CSS and uses JavaScript to trigger the download.

## 📌 Features  
- Displays a button to download an image.  
- Uses JavaScript to create a dynamic link for downloading.  
- Includes a simulated 3-second delay before the download starts.  
- Styled using CSS for a clean and responsive design.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The webpage loads and waits for the user to click the "Download Image" button.  
2. When clicked, the script logs "Downloading file..." and waits for 3 seconds.  
3. After the delay, it logs "Download complete!" and creates a temporary link to the image file.  
4. The link is clicked programmatically to start the download.  
5. The temporary link is removed from the document to keep it clean.
